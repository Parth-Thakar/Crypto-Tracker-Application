# Crypto Tracker App

Crypto Tracker Android application for tracking and analyzing the current market data of the Crypto fetched from the CoinMarketCap API and displayed over the application. It will also fetch the Current live Chart using the TradingView Api on the application. The UI/UX of the app looks very similar to BitBns crypto trading application. I have tried my best to Clone the UI of that application.
